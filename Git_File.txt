* It is started with less talk, Stimuli, C++, Java, Python, C#...

* It's a freeware/non-commercial.

* It's an open source.

* It's a platform independent programming language.

* Java is a multithreaded architecture.

* Java has a powerful exception handling mechanism.

* Java has a powerful memory management mechanism.

* Java has Its own run time environment.

* Java high-level programming language.

* Java can support to develop multiple platform publication.


2.semi colon; - end of statement

3.Case sensitive
Eg: Selenium - Capital letter S
    selenium - small letter s
	
4.open/close curly brace-{}

5-open/close Dimension-[]

6.Open/close Paranthesis-()

7.Command:- executable by JVM
----------
    System.Out.Println();- Printing command and prints the output in a new line
	System.Out.Print();- Prints the command,but all the outputs are displayed in a single line

8.Comment: - cannot executed by JVM(description in the program)
----------
Single line comment - double blackslash - //
Multi line comment - description for a paragraph
Syntax:
    /*
     *Multi line comments
	 */
	 
9.JAVA Process:
   1.Creating source file
   2.Saving java file with extension .java
   Ex: Testfile.java
   3.Compile the java file - Javac creates a .class file
   ex; Testfile.class
   Class file contains binary codes 0's and 1's
   Ex: Testfile.class
   
10.Creating and executing Java program using Notepad:
----------------------------------------------------
1.Create a Java program in the notepad and save it with an extention .Java with same as class name
Ex:Test.java

2.Navigate to folder path and copy the folder path

3.Open command prompt
Give the folder drivve and enter
Eg:c:\User\parth.E:

E:

4.Now enter cd give the complee folder path
cd E:\Parthiban

E:\Parthiban

5. To compile the java file give command in cmd and click on tab to get the file. Select the fille and erase the extension in cmd
Javac Test.Java

E:\Parthiban>Javac Test.java

6.After compilation, compiler creates the Class file with extension .class in the source file folder
Ex: Test.Class

7.To execute the class file, give the command as java and click on tab to get the class file with extension .class. Clear the extension .class and click on Enter

E:\Parthiban>java Test

Output will be displayed in the command prompt

1.Data management:
     Store the data in the Java memory  and it can be retrieved later
	 
Store and retrieve the data:
----------------------------
Variable and Datatypes:
-----------------------
    To store data in Java memory - there is a place holder called variable
Variable - adderess/reference to store the value in the Java memory
Variavle should always be alpha, Variable name should be unique

Datatype:
    depends the data/value to ve stored. Different data types are available 
Ex:int
	 
Syntax:
int x=100;
int - datatype,
x - variable,
100 - data

keywords(data types):
    1.primitive, 2.Non primitive 3.Reference
	
Primitive
---------
1.Byte - 1 byte
2.Short - 2 byte
3.Int - 4 byte
4.Long - 8 byte
5.Double - 8 byte
6.Float - 4 byte
7.Char - 2 byte
8.Bollean - 1 bit

Non Primitive
-------------
1.String
2.Array

Reference :(Leter)
---------

Variable declaration: declaring the variable only -> Eg: int x;
Variable Initialisation: assigning the value to the variable
Eg: int x=100;
   
   
   
 OPERATERS:
 ----------
Used to perform the operation more than one variable;
ex:int a=100;
   int b=200;
   a+b;
   
   a,b--> operands
   '+'--> operator
   
   1.Arithmetic operator --> arithmatic oprations --> + , - , * , /
   2.Relational operator --> Compares 2 variable --> < , > , <= ,>= (Output will be boolean value true or false only)
   3.Logical operator --> AND(&&),OR(||),NOT(!)
   4.Assignment aperator
   5.Equivlence operator
   6.Concatenation operator
   7.Incremental operator
   8.Decremental operator
   9.Conditional/Ternary operator
   10.Bitwise Operator
   
 logical operator:
 
   AND:'&' --> 2 operand, both condition  should be true
   
   OR: '||' -->either one of the conditions should be satisfied
   
   NOT: '!' -->
   
Concatenation Operator: '+'

  * Joins two String value
   
Assignment Operator: '='

Equivalence Operator: '=='

Incremental Operator: '++'
  * Increments one value to the current assigned variable. Used in loops/Iteration
  * Pre/Post Incremental Operator:
  Eg: x=10
  ++x; 
  x++; now x=11
Decremental Operator: '--'
  * Pre/Post Decremental Operator:
  Eg: x=10
  --x;
  x--; now x=9
  
Conditional/Ternary Operator: '?:'
 
 Function/Methods:
 -----------------------------------------------
1.Collection of java program/statements
2.Function is a block
3.In java programs can be developed within the functions only
4.Two type of functions--> Predefined and User defined Function
5.A class can Have any number of function
6.The function name should represent a verbalfrom - (verbe-actions)
7.The function name should start with small latter and incase if it has more than 2 functions, use camlcase
     Eg: doLogin
8.Function are parallel to each other and it should not overlap
9.We can call one function from other function
10.A function can be called any number of times
11.A function can be accept any number of arguments
12.A function can return only one value
13.A function name should be unique
14.If more than one function has a same name but with different parameters is called function overloading
15.Function can be static or non-static
